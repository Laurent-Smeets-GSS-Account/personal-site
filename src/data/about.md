# Intro

I like to say I’m standing where data science, official statistics, policy, and development all overlap. My fascination with numbers, problem-solving, and global issues has taken me from research labs in the Netherlands and China to bustling government offices in Ghana. Travel has always been important to me: in 2017, I had the unforgettable opportunity to hitchhike from the southern tip of Argentina to the northernmost point of Alaska. And just last year, I set up my “office” in the front seat of a 30-year-old Land Rover, spending eight months roaming through Africa in that faithful (if occasionally stubborn) vehicle.

# Journey

My path to becoming a data scientist hasn’t been a straight line, but—like my travels—it’s always been about the journey rather than the destination. I started off at Leiden University, studying International Relations and learning how trade partners can nudge undemocratic countries toward democracy. That experience confirmed how politics, policy, and data often mesh together in surprising ways.

# 

Next came a Master of Laws (LL.M.) at the Yenching Academy of Peking University, where I immersed myself in Chinese domestic economic challenges and foreign policy (with a dash of panda diplomacy). Eventually, I returned to the Netherlands to earn my Research Master’s in Methodology and Statistics from Utrecht University. There, I delved into Bayesian analyses, R code development, and machine learning.

# 
After a brief stint at Statistics Netherlands, I moved to Ghana to work for the Ghana Statistical Service (GSS)—first as an ODI fellow and later as their head of Data Science, setting up a new Data Science Unit. In between, I worked with GOPA, UNFPA, and the World Bank on various data-driven projects—from harnessing geospatial analytics for improved policy-making to developing machine learning algorithms for large-scale data matching.
When I’m not fixing bugs in code, you’ll find me satisfying my travel bug in countless ways—always exploring new roads, new datasets, and new perspectives.
